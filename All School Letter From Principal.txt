| have spent a lot of time this academic year repeating the mantra resilience
and adaptability, two characteristics | value highly. Resilience, as commonly
defined, is the capacity to keep going in the face of difficulty, and adaptability
is the ability to adjust to new circumstances. | am proud of the way everyone in
our entire School community—students, faculty, and staff—has displayed
resilience and adaptability in the face of a multitude of challenges.

For me, resilience was required by the very fact that COVID-19 forced us to
close the campus for the spring and much of the summer. We could not be
together as an in-person community, and what we do in-person together brings
me such joy. | thrive on the chance interactions in the hallways, visiting classes
or dropping by a dorm in the evening, engaging in conversations at lunch and
dinner, watching music and drama performances, and cheering on our athletic
teams. Like you, | needed to adapt to a Zoom way of interacting, for me with
advisees, the monitors, larger groups of students, my faculty and staff
colleagues, and parents and graduates. We had some excellent moments as a
School last spring nonetheless, thanks to the hard work and creative thinking of
many which | deeply appreciate. Our 2020 Prize Day week events come
particularly to mind.
